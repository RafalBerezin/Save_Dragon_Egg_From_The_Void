A simple Minecraft data pack to keep the Dragon Egg from falling into the Void.

---

This works for both Dragon Egg item and falling block.

When the Dragon Egg falls into the void, it'll fall on top of the **Exit Portal** in **The End** instead. To be specific, if the chunk is loaded, it'll appear 10 blocks above the highest block on **x0 z0** coordinates, and at **y 256** if it's not loaded.

---

If you want to be notified when the Dragoon Egg is saved from the Void, you can use the `/function commands:dragon_egg/toggle_notification` command to toggle the notification.
