A simple Minecraft data pack to keep the Dragon Egg from falling into the Void.

**IMPORTANT**: This only works for the falling Dragon Egg block, not the item.

When the Egg falls into the void it'll fall on top of the **Exit Portal** in **The End** instead. To be specific, if the chunk is loaded it'll appear 10 blocks above the highest block on **x0 z0** coordinates, and at **y 256** if it's not loaded.
